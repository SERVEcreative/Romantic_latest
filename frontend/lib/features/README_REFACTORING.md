# Feature Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the refactoring of the calls and messaging functionality from the dashboard into separate, well-organized feature folders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Calls Feature (`lib/features/calls/`)

#### Structure:
```
calls/
├── models/
│   └── call_models.dart          # Call-related data models
├── services/
│   └── call_service.dart         # Call business logic
└── screens/
    ├── call_history_screen.dart  # Call history list
    ├── incoming_call_screen.dart # Incoming call UI
    └── outgoing_call_screen.dart # Outgoing call UI
```

#### Key Components:
- **Call Models**: `Call`, `CallType`, `CallStatus`, `CallHistory`
- **Call Service**: Handles call operations (make, accept, reject, end)
- **Call History Screen**: Displays recent calls with status indicators
- **Incoming Call Screen**: Enhanced UI for incoming calls with accept/reject options
- **Outgoing Call Screen**: Enhanced UI for outgoing calls with connection status

### 2. Messaging Feature (`lib/features/messaging/`)

#### Structure:
```
messaging/
├── models/
│   └── message_models.dart       # Message-related data models
├── services/
│   └── messaging_service.dart    # Messaging business logic
└── screens/
    ├── conversation_list_screen.dart # Conversation list
    └── chat_screen.dart          # Individual chat interface
```

#### Key Components:
- **Message Models**: `Message`, `MessageType`, `Conversation`, `ChatRoom`
- **Messaging Service**: Handles message operations (send, receive, mark as read)
- **Conversation List Screen**: Displays all conversations with unread counts
- **Chat Screen**: Enhanced chat interface with typing indicators and emoji support

### 3. Dashboard Updates

#### Changes:
- Removed inline call and message screens from dashboard
- Updated imports to use new feature screens
- Simplified dashboard code by delegating to feature modules

#### Before:
```dart
case 1:
  return _buildCallsScreen();  // Inline implementation
case 2:
  return _buildMessagesScreen(); // Inline implementation
```

#### After:
```dart
case 1:
  return const CallHistoryScreen();  // Dedicated feature
case 2:
  return const ConversationListScreen(); // Dedicated feature
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Better Code Organization**
- Each feature has its own folder with clear separation of concerns
- Models, services, and screens are logically grouped
- Easier to locate and maintain specific functionality

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Changes to calls or messaging don't affect dashboard code
- Each feature can be developed and tested independently
- Clear boundaries between different functionalities

### 3. **Enhanced Scalability**
- Easy to add new features following the same pattern
- Services can be extended without affecting UI
- Models can be enhanced without breaking existing functionality

### 4. **Better User Experience**
- Dedicated screens for each feature with enhanced UI
- Improved call handling with proper incoming/outgoing states
- Better messaging interface with conversation management

## Migration Guide

### For Developers:

1. **Import Updates**: Update imports to use new feature paths
2. **Service Usage**: Use the new service classes for business logic
3. **Navigation**: Navigate to new screen classes instead of inline implementations

### For Testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each service independently
2. **Widget Tests**: Test each screen in isolation
3. **Integration Tests**: Test feature workflows end-to-end

## Future Enhancements

### Calls Feature:
- Video call support
- Call recording functionality
- Call quality indicators
- Conference call support

### Messaging Feature:
- Voice messages
- File sharing
- Message reactions
- Group chat support
- Message encryption

## Dependencies

The refactored features maintain the same dependencies as the original implementation:
- `flutter/material.dart`
- `google_fonts`
- `shared/models/user_profile.dart`
- `core/utils/logger.dart`

## Notes

- All existing functionality has been preserved
- UI improvements have been added to enhance user experience
- Mock data is used for demonstration purposes
- Real API integration can be easily added to the service classes
